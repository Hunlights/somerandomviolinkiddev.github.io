(current road map of the game)

new things:

    planet buildings:
        oil drill
            unlocks manual oil pumping
            upgrades:
                output
        oil rig
            automatic oil gain 
            
        drilling facility:
            needs workers, gives resources
            
        power plant
            produces energy from oil and gas
            upgrades: 
                energy conversion (increases oil/gas to power rate)
                capacity (able to accept more oil/gas per tick)
        oil refinery
            produces gas from oil
            

    planet orbital buildings:
        space elevator

    system buildings:
        matrioshka brain
            gives large amounts of research but consumes large amounts of energy

    research:
        
    resources:
        oil (can be converted to energy in early game, maybe like 1 oil to 2 energy? could be upgradeable)
        gas (made from oil refinery, better conversion to energy and used in rocket fuel)
        
    ui/graphical:
        research tree
        detailed views of planet, solar system, and galaxy
